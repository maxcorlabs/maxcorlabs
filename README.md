- ðŸ‘‹ This is the github for Maxcor labs. 
- âœ¨ We also have a public tableau at https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maxcor3014 .
- ðŸ‘€ Our research group is interested in cost effectiveness in healthcare.
- ðŸŒ± Maxcor labs is a collaboration of scientists and medical doctors.
- ðŸ‘€ Our lab works with large amounts of data. Proprietary tools are limited in thier capabilities to handle large amounts of data. For example in Microsoft Excel, when there are  over 1,048,576 rows of tabular data ([according to Microsoft](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/excel-specifications-and-limits-1672b34d-7043-467e-8e27-269d656771c3)) the tool can not be used for all the data at once. We are working to publish open source code and large data sets directly, making us an independant repository of vital health data.
